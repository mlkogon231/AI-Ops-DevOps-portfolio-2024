Building an AIOps/DevOps Portfolio Demo on Azure



MK
I need to learn AI ops, that is something I need to learn as a skilled cloud engineer with no employment who has a web portfolio.  I think it would be a good idea to have an AIOps/DevOps demo on there usuing Azure resources


I'll help you create a meaningful AIOps/DevOps demo for your portfolio using Azure. This is indeed a valuable addition given the increasing convergence of cloud, DevOps, and AI operations.

Let me design a practical demo project that would showcase relevant skills:


AIOps Demo Infrastructure
Click to open code
This demo infrastructure includes several key components that showcase AIOps capabilities:

Application Monitoring:
Application Insights for detailed application telemetry
Log Analytics Workspace for centralized logging
Azure Monitor alerts for automated incident detection
Container Infrastructure:
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for container orchestration
Azure Container Registry for image management
Auto-scaling capabilities built into the cluster
Automated Operations:
Metric-based alerting
Webhook integration for automated responses
Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
To make this demo even more impressive, I recommend adding:

A sample application deployed to AKS that:
Generates meaningful metrics
Implements auto-scaling
Uses Application Insights for monitoring
A GitHub Actions pipeline that:
Builds and tests the application
Deploys infrastructure changes
Implements automated rollback capabilities
A dashboard showing:
Application health metrics
Infrastructure costs
Performance analytics
Would you like me to help you with any of these additional components? We could start with either setting up the basic infrastructure or creating the sample application.

Yes, what do I do with the AIOPS demo infrastrcuture code on the right here


I'll guide you through setting up this AIOps demo infrastructure step by step.

First, you'll need to set up your local environment:
bash

Copy
# Install Azure CLI if you haven't already
curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLI | bash

# Install Terraform
# For Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y terraform

# Log into Azure
az login
Create a new directory and organize your files:
bash

Copy
mkdir aiops-demo
cd aiops-demo
Create these files in your directory:
Copy the infrastructure code from the artifact into main.tf
Create a new file called variables.tf:

AIOps Demo Variables
Click to open code
Initialize and deploy the infrastructure:
bash

Copy
# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# See what changes will be made
terraform plan

# Apply the changes
terraform apply
After deployment, set up your Kubernetes credentials:
bash

Copy
# Get AKS credentials
az aks get-credentials --resource-group aiops-demo-rg --name aiops-demo-aks
For your portfolio, I recommend creating a README.md that explains the project:

AIOps Demo README
Click to open document
Next steps for enhancing your demo:
a. Create a monitoring dashboard:

bash

Copy
# Get your subscription ID
SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account show --query id -o tsv)

# Create a dashboard using Azure CLI
az portal dashboard create --resource-group aiops-demo-rg \
    --name "AIOps-Demo-Dashboard" \
    --subscription $SUBSCRIPTION_ID
b. Set up a sample application to monitor. Would you like me to help you create:

A simple microservice application that generates metrics
Kubernetes manifests for deployment
GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
Which aspect would you like to focus on next? We can:

Deploy a sample application to generate metrics
Set up the monitoring dashboard
Create the CI/CD pipeline
Add more sophisticated alerting rules
Let me know which part you'd like to tackle first!

I need to start with vscode and a repo, I will get that ready, then start in with mkdir aiops-demo going from here


That's a good approach - let's get your development environment set up properly first.

Start by creating a new GitHub repository:
Name it something like "azure-aiops-demo"
Initialize with a README
Add a .gitignore for Terraform (select Terraform template if available)
In VS Code, you'll want these essential extensions:

Copy
- HashiCorp Terraform
- Azure Terraform
- YAML
- Kubernetes
- Azure CLI Tools
Then clone your repo and set up the basic structure:
bash

Copy
# Clone your repo
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd azure-aiops-demo

# Create the project structure
mkdir -p infrastructure/terraform
mkdir -p kubernetes
mkdir -p scripts
mkdir -p .github/workflows
Create this initial file structure:

Copy
azure-aiops-demo/
│
├── infrastructure/
│   └── terraform/
│       ├── main.tf         # Main infrastructure code
│       ├── variables.tf    # Variable definitions
│       ├── outputs.tf      # Output definitions
│       └── terraform.tfvars.example  # Example variables file
│
├── kubernetes/            # For K8s manifests later
│   └── README.md
│
├── scripts/              # Helper scripts
│   └── README.md
│
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/        # CI/CD pipelines
│
├── .gitignore
└── README.md
Create a .gitignore file if it wasn't initialized with one:

Git Ignore File
Click to open code
Initialize the repository with your first commit:
bash

Copy
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project structure"
git push origin main
Create a new branch for development:
bash

Copy
git checkout -b feature/initial-infrastructure
Now you're ready to start adding the infrastructure code we discussed earlier. Would you like to proceed with:

Adding the Terraform configuration files
Setting up Azure authentication for local development
Creating the basic GitHub Actions workflow
Let me know which part you'd like to tackle next, and I'll provide the specific steps and code for that portion.

Remember: Before running any Terraform commands, you'll need to:

Have Azure CLI installed and be logged in (az login)
Have Terraform installed
Have proper Azure permissions in your subscription

new topic:

you have a tablet, it says 100 percentg battery, when I try to turn it on , you swipe it to turn it on, or press the bottom, nothing happens, this is a samsung


Let me help you troubleshoot your Samsung tablet that's not responding despite showing a 100% battery.

First, let's try a forced restart, which often resolves frozen devices:

Press and hold both the Power button AND the Volume Down button at the same time
Hold both buttons for at least 10-12 seconds until the screen goes black and the Samsung logo appears
Release the buttons when you see the logo
If that doesn't work, try this sequence:

Press and hold the Power button for at least 20 seconds
Release and wait 30 seconds
Try turning it on normally
If still unresponsive:

Connect your tablet to its original charger
Leave it charging for 30 minutes
Try the forced restart again while connected to power
If none of these work, there might be a deeper issue. Could you tell me:

How old is the tablet?
Has it had any recent drops or water exposure?
Did this happen suddenly or was there any unusual behavior before?
This will help me provide more specific troubleshooting steps.

this is a samsung model number sm-t800


Ah, that's the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5 (SM-T800) - a tablet from around 2014. For this specific model, let's try some known fixes:

First, try this specific button combination for this model:
Press and hold Volume Up + Home + Power buttons simultaneously
Hold all three for at least 10-12 seconds until you see the Samsung logo
If you see "Recovery Mode," use volume buttons to navigate and power button to select "Reboot System Now"
If that doesn't work, while the tablet is off:
Press and hold Volume Down + Home + Power buttons together
When you see the warning screen, press Volume Up to continue
This will boot into Recovery Mode
Use volume buttons to navigate to "Wipe Cache Partition"
Use Power button to select
After it's done, select "Reboot System Now"
If still no response:
Remove any case or cover
Look for a tiny reset hole on the back of the tablet
Using a paperclip, gently press and hold the reset button for 10 seconds
Try turning it on normally
If these don't work:
Connect to the original Samsung charger
Leave it charging for at least an hour (sometimes the battery indicator can be incorrect)
Try the first step again while connected to power
Given the age of this model (about 10 years), there's a possibility the battery might have failed despite showing 100%. Would you like me to provide next steps if none of these solutions work?

it turn on with a swipe, how do i get to turn it on


If the tablet is turning on with a swipe (showing the screen) but you're having trouble with the basic operations, here are the key navigation tips for the SM-T800 (Galaxy Tab S 10.5):

Once the screen is visible:
Swipe UP from the bottom of the screen (not just anywhere) to unlock
If it has a pattern/PIN lock, you'll need to enter that after swiping
If that's not working, try:
Placing your finger at the very bottom center of the screen
Swiping straight up in one smooth motion
Don't release until you've swiped about halfway up the screen
Alternative unlock methods:
Look for a small arrow or lock icon on the screen
Place your finger on that icon and swipe in any direction
Some variants might require swiping from left to right
Is the screen showing any particular icons or patterns when you try to swipe? This would help me give you more specific guidance for your situation.

nothing happens when I swipe from the bottom


Since nothing happens when you swipe from the bottom, let's check if the screen is actually frozen or if the touch sensitivity isn't working properly.

Try these steps in order:

First, force restart to rule out a frozen screen:
Press and hold both Power + Volume Down buttons together
Hold for 10-12 seconds until screen goes black
Let it restart and try swiping again
If that doesn't work, clean the screen:
Power off the tablet
Use a slightly damp microfiber cloth
Pay special attention to the bottom area
Dry thoroughly
Try again
If still not working, try Safe Mode:
Press and hold the Power button until "Samsung" appears
When the Samsung logo appears, press and hold Volume Down
Hold until the device finishes restarting
You should see "Safe Mode" in bottom left corner
Try swiping now - if it works in Safe Mode, an app might be causing the issue
Test different swipe areas:
Try swiping from different spots along the bottom edge
Try swiping from the very edge (where the screen meets the bezel)
Try swiping from slightly above the bottom edge
Can you tell me if the screen responds to touches in other areas, or is it completely unresponsive to all touch input?

ok, can you take me back to where we were before I tried to fix the tablet


We were working on setting up an AIOps/DevOps demo project in Azure. Here's where we left off:

We were about to start setting up your development environment with:

Setting up a new GitHub repository for your AIOps demo
Installing VS Code extensions:
HashiCorp Terraform
Azure Terraform
YAML
Kubernetes
Azure CLI Tools
Then create the initial project structure:

bash

Copy
# Clone your repo
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd azure-aiops-demo

# Create the project structure
mkdir -p infrastructure/terraform
mkdir -p kubernetes
mkdir -p scripts
mkdir -p .github/workflows
You mentioned you needed to start with VS Code and setting up a repo first. Would you like to:

Start with creating the GitHub repository?
Set up the VS Code environment?
Or do you need help with something else first?
Let me know which step you'd like to tackle first!

I did the mkdir's lets go on to the next step please


Great, now that you have your directory structure, let's add the core infrastructure files:

First, navigate into your terraform directory:
bash

Copy
cd infrastructure/terraform
Create the main Terraform files. I'll split the previous infrastructure code into more manageable files.
Let's start with your main configuration and provider setup:


Base Terraform Configuration
Click to open code
Initialize the Terraform working directory:
bash

Copy
# Initialize Terraform
terraform init
Before we proceed with deployment, let's set up Azure authentication:
bash

Copy
# Login to Azure
az login

# Set your subscription (if you have multiple)
az account set --subscription "Your-Subscription-Name-or-ID"
Create a backend configuration for storing Terraform state (recommended for team work):

Terraform Backend Configuration
Click to open code
Create the storage account for the backend:
bash

Copy
# Create resource group for terraform state
az group create --name terraform-state-rg --location eastus

# Create storage account (replace YOURUNIQUENAME with something unique)
az storage account create \
    --name tfstateYOURUNIQUENAME \
    --resource-group terraform-state-rg \
    --sku Standard_LRS \
    --encryption-services blob

# Create blob container
az storage container create \
    --name tfstate \
    --account-name tfstateYOURUNIQUENAME
Commit your changes:
bash

Copy
git add .
git commit -m "Add initial Terraform configuration"
git push origin main
Would you like to:

Proceed with deploying this basic infrastructure?
Add the AKS cluster configuration next?
Set up the monitoring and alerting components?
Let me know which direction you'd like to go next!
